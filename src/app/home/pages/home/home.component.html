                    Since beginning my programming journey 5 years ago (professionally) I've held many roles;
                    Sys Admin, Business Analyst, DevOps Engineer, Fullstack Engineer, I've helped scale out
                    websites for large international organisations, coded messaging bots from scratch,
                    created business-oriented software, and architected microservice solutions for IT bottlenecks.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I'm passionate about IT and always learning (even on weekends), I've made mistakes and learned from them,
                    I've done my best to expand my IT arsenal to understand some of the top current technologies including NodeJS,
                    GraphQL, Docker, Angular, Ionic, WordPress, Stripe, and many more frontend and backend tools.
